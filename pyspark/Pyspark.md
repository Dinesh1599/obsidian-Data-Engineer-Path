**PySpark is the Python interface to Apache Spark.**  
It lets you use **Python** to work with **Spark’s distributed data processing engine**.

Instead of processing data on one machine, PySpark distributes work across many machines, making it fast for big data.

PySpark = Python + Spark for bid data processing.
