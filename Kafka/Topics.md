A **topic** is a **named stream of events** in Kafka.

- Acts like a **logical channel or category**
    
- Events in a topic are stored in an **append-only log**
    
- Topics are split into **partitions** for scalability and parallelism
    

Example topics:

- user_activity
    
- payments
    
- application_logs
    

**Key idea:** Topics organize and store streams of related events.
