**Summary â€” What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining datasets to understand their key characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps analysts:

- Explore data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.
- Gain confidence in data quality before applying machine learning models.
- Identify errors, anomalies, and structural patterns in the dataset.
- ==Develop a basic understanding of the data to guide questions and determine the best ways to manipulate it for answers.==
- Support business processes by preparing datasets for deeper analysis and problem detection.
- Create quick, initial models (baseline models) for comparison against future, more refined models.

Overall, EDA is a foundational step in data analysis that bridges raw data exploration and advanced modeling.
