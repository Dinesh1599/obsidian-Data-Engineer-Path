**Data modeling** is the process of organizing raw data into a structured format so it can be stored, understood, and queried efficiently for analytics and reporting.

More Explaination:

**Data modeling** defines **how data is structured, related, and stored** in a database or data warehouse. It translates real-world business concepts (customers, orders, events) into tables, columns, and relationships that machines can process efficiently.

Instead of keeping data as scattered files or logs, data modeling gives it **shape, meaning, and rules**.
