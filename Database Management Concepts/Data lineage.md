**Data lineage is the end-to-end traceability of data as it moves from source systems through ingestion, transformation, storage, and consumption layers. It records where data originates, how it is transformed, and where it is ultimately used.**

## What Data lineage includes
- Source system where data is created
- Ingestion pipeline and ETL processes
- Transformation logic and business rules
