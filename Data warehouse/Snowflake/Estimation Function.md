Exact value can take time. But sometimes an approx value is good enough. thus getting this approx value can save so much time and use fewer resources. 

1. HLL() - Number of distinct values (DISCTINCT from SQL)
	1. Used whenever to count distinct values
	2. Basically resplaces SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(ORDER_NAME));
	3. Very time saving

2. APPROX_TOP_K() Frequent values
	1. 






3. APPROX_PERCENTILE() - Percentile values
4. MINHASH + APPROXIMATE_SIMILARITY() - Similarity of 2 or more sets
