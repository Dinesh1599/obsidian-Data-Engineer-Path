1. Shared Disk Architecture is a system design approach where multiple computers (nodes) access the same centralized disk storage simultaneously.

2. Advantage:
	1. **Scalability:** Easy to add new nodes for increased workload without massive infrastructure changes.
	2. **High Availability:** Storage remains accessible even if some nodes fail, ensuring continuous service.
	3. **Simplified Data Management:** Centralized storage makes backups, replication, and recovery easier.
	4. **Resource Efficiency:** Reduces data duplication, improves utilization, and simplifies overall data consistency.
